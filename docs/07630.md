## CSS 边距介绍

CSS 边距允许我们设置 HTML 元素之间的间距，以获得更好的外观和更整洁的 UI。根据最新的 CSS 定义，一个元素可以在顶部、底部、左侧和右侧给出边距。边距值以像素为单位设置。

### 边距属性

除了设置精确的边距值，CSS 还允许我们将以下值设置为边距属性:

<small>网页开发、编程语言、软件测试&其他</small>

*   **auto:** 通过这些选项，我们让浏览器计算元素的边距
*   **长度:**如前所述，我们可以用像素、磅、厘米等单位指定精确的边距。
*   **%:** 我们可以将边距值指定为包含它的元素的宽度的百分比。
*   **inherit:** 这样，我们指定元素的边距值应该从其父元素继承

### 在 CSS 中设置单个边的边距

CSS 允许我们为具有以下属性的元素的每一侧单独设置边距值:

*   **Margin-top:** 设置元素顶部的边距。
*   **Margin-bottom:** 设置元素底部的边距。
*   **Margin-left:** 设置元素左边的边距。
*   **Margin-right:** 设置元素右边的边距。

或者，我们也可以使用 CSS 中的速记边距属性，通过如下所示的单个定义来设置元素所有边的边距:

#### 示例#1

**边距:** <边距上限值> <边距右限值> <边距下限值> <边距左限值>

**代码:**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.p1
{
margin-top: 100px;
}
.p2
{
margin-bottom: 100px;
}
.p3
{
margin-right: 150px;
}
.p4 {
margin-left: 80px;
}
Div {
background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h2>In this example, we are using individual margin properties</h2>
<div>
<p class="p1">

```

**输出:**

浏览器窗口中上述示例的输出如下所示:

#### 实施例 2

为了在上面的例子中设置我们选择的边距，我们必须定义边距值四次。现在，让我们在下面的示例中用 margin 速记属性设置相同的边距值:

**代码:**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div
{
Margin : 100px 150px 100px 80px; // defining all margin values in a single definition
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h2>In this example, we are using the short hand margin property </h2>
<div>

</body>

```

**输出:**

使用速记属性，浏览器窗口中的输出将如下所示:

### 结论

我们可以设置 HTML 元素的 margin 属性，或者使用单独的属性，如 margin-left、margin-right、margin-top、margin-bottom，或者我们可以在 margin 速记值的帮助下定义所有的 margin 值。两者将产生相同的结果，唯一的区别是具有速记属性的代码将更有效且更易于应用
